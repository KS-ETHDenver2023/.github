# **Alice's Ring**

**Enhance privacy, Prove solvency**

In an increasingly connected Blockchain ecosystem, it becomes difficult to untie your on-chain activity from your identity. Alice's Ring allows you to separate your addresses from your identity while giving you the ability to leverage your funds in the physical world.

## **Features** ✨

- Accessible and intuitive [web application](https://link_to_deployed_web_app) 🌐
- Robust smart contracts⚡
- SoulBound tokens as timestamped proof of solvency 🔒
- Generation of cryptographic proof in a local environment 🖥️
- High-performance cryptographic processes🗝️

## **Our code** 👨‍💻

- [Web application](https://github.com/KS-ETHDenver2023/Web_App-Alice_Ring) : The easiest way to generate and verify a solvency proof.

- [ZkBob direct deposit](https://github.com/KS-ETHDenver2023/zkbob-direct-deposit) : Now you can transfer BOB stablecoin without leaking your address

- [On-chain verifier](https://github.com/KS-ETHDenver2023/Alice-ring-SoulBound-Token) : The heart of our system, it connects each of the modules of the project.

- [Cryptographic verifier](https://github.com/KS-ETHDenver2023/AOS-Ring) : It allows anyone to verify an AOS ring signature using it's smart contract.

- [SoulBound tokens](https://github.com/KS-ETHDenver2023/Alice-ring-SoulBound-Token) : The best way for our provers to show their proof of solvency linked with their communication address.

-  [Cryptographic proof built in a local environment](https://github.com/KS-ETHDenver2023/ring_signature) : Ring signature directly generated in your computer, no internet connection needed.

## **The team** 🏆

**The team consists of 4 committed people who love what they do.**

We are all students bound by our passion and commitment for blockchain and Web3. We want to develop innovative solutions that will help the whole ecosystem expand. Too many times have we seen privacy being set aside in projects and we want to be able to change that. That is why Maxime, Nathan, Thomas and Adam are glad to present Alice’s ring, the solution for real privacy.

By addressing the need for privacy in the blockchain ecosystem while having a real utility in our daily life, Alice's Ring has the potential to be a valuable tool for individuals and businesses alike.


## **Contribute** 📚

Our project is intended as open source and as a tool for the Ethereum community and all web3 users.
